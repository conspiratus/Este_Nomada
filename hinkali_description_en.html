  Khinkali are a traditional Georgian dish: large, pleated parcels filled
  with juicy meat and hot broth inside. We prepare our khinkali with a
  mixture of minced <strong>beef and lamb</strong>, onion, spices, and freshly
  ground black pepper to preserve their characteristic flavor and aroma.

  The dough is rolled and shaped by hand into the classic "pouch" with a
  twisted top, while the center remains filled with flavorful meat juice.
  Khinkali are a hearty, comforting main course.

<h3>Serving</h3>

<p>
  Khinkali are traditionally eaten by hand: you hold the top, take a small
  bite, drink the broth, and then finish the rest. They are served hot, with
  freshly ground black pepper, optionally accompanied by fresh herbs and
  bread. Light salads and yogurt-based sauces pair well with the dish.
  The meal is often finished with hot tea.
